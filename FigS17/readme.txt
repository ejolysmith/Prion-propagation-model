The C file names are similar to those in the Fig5 directories, with similar instructions. 
They are different in that they include fluctuating chaperones. The chaperone production 
rate was varied three times directly in the definition of the rate in the C files, to 
produce the three different chaperone dynamics. Python files generate the figures in Fig. S17.
