prion-model_single-stochastic.c when compiled generates the trajectories in FigS20a (must run the simulation 
3 times while changing parameters lambda_L at begining of code). 
prion-model_time-relative-to-loss-stochastic.c when compiled generates the data shown in FigS20b.
prion-model_tloss-stochastic.c when compiled generates the data shown in FigS20c
prion-model_divs-relative-to-loss.c when compiled genreates the data shown in FigS20d,e

The compiled executables are located in the directory. 

The python files used to make the figures are also in the directory.
