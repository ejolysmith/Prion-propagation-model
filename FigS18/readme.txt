Contains C code used to generate numerical data used in Fig S18, along with python files used to make the figures. 
Files are named anagolously to those in Fig5 and FigS17 directories (with "-slow" indicating the slow pulsing 
chaperone dynamics), with instructions in those directories on running the code. 

To switch off the chaperone dynamics, the chaperone production rate was manually changed with a factor of 0, 
and the fragmentation rate was manually changed to get rid of chaperone dependence.
